# Simplest scenario for the Package Constructor build system
# - Container build

---

# Defines the container build
kind: container

# Defines the working directory where the constructor will be executed
# and will store all the generated files
workdir:
  # Path to the working directory relative to the configuration file
  path: ./cache/

# Each source will be cloned into a volume
# and then added to the container build
sources:
  - kind: git
    url: https://github.com/pyca/cryptography.git
    ref: "41.0.5"
    path: cryptography

# Each package manager will have a respective proxy service available
# for the container build
packageManagers:
  # Ansible roles and collections
  # creates the files:
  #   $WORKDIR/constructor/packagemanager/ansible/requirements.yml
  #   $WORKDIR/constructor/packagemanager/ansible/requirements-freeze.txt
  ansible:
    # Collections. Must include the package name and version
    collections:
      - community-general==6.2.0
    # Roles. Must include the package name and version
    roles:
      - cloudalchemy.node_exporter==2.0.0

  # Python package manager
  # creates the file $WORKDIR/constructor/packagemanager/python/requirements-freeze.txt
  python:
    # If true, it will search for all the dependencies to build the package
    includeDependencies: true
    # Dependencies. Must include the package name and version
    dependencies:
      - cryptography==41.0.5

# Assuming "kind: containers", the container key is required
# Each container will be built sequentially. You can chain them.
